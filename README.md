### INSOFE Project Repository: Hands-On Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of data science and machine learning projects completed as part of the coursework at the International School of Engineering (INSOFE). Each project demonstrates the application of data science techniques, from exploratory data analysis to advanced machine learning models, to solve various real-world problems.

Business context:
The ABC Insurance Group, consists of 10 property and casualty insurance,
life insurance and insurance brokerage companies. The property and
casualty companies in the group operate in a 17-state region. Mutual group
is a major regional property and casualty insurer, represented by more than
4,000 independent agents who live and work in local communities through
a six-state region. Define the metrics to analyse agent performance based
on several attributes like demography, products sold, new business, etc.
ABC is interested in improving their existing knowledge used for agent
segmentation in a supervised predictive framework. 

This project is an academic project predicting the performance of the insurance sales agent for next year.
The final model is an ensemblled model of 3 ML models where the weights of each model are decided by an optimisation 

#### Repository Highlights:
